**Q:** ***What makes you qualified to rant?***

**A:** I'm an over-educated jewess from New York. No, really. Ok, not really. But, still. 

I went to grad school for Industrial Design, and although I'm not practicing it in the traditional sense, I can shed a lot of light onto design decisions, manufacturing, and how you're being marketed towards.

**Q:** ***So why did you start this blog?***

**A:** Because the internet needs more cynicism. 

Just kidding. We all know the [internet](http://www.reddit.com/) has plenty of cynicism. 

I started this because within the product design/interiors space there's very little thoughtful criticism, which I see as a problem. We live in a world of products, both digital and physical, and our consumption of them drives the economy. Sadly, people don't always think much about the things that they buy. They think some, which is why there are market segments, but beyond that few seem to be making choices based on quality, economics, manufacturing, and usability.[^fn-There are some good product reviews] 

We also shouldn't forget that we live in an age where we curate our identities by the products we choose to use. There are industries created in and around this idea. Ethnographers are 'embedded in the field', trying to figure out what 12 year old girls *really want* out of school-locker managment. They're out there sifting through data to extrapolate your buying habits, so that they can entice you with your next purchase before you're even thinking of it. 

I'm not saying it's evil, just that you should know. You should all know, and make better purchases for it. After all, there aren't a lot of ways to speak in this world, except with your paycheck. 

[^fn-There are some good product reviews]: There's lots of quality reviews in the digital product and gadget arenas. Rarely are these quality reviews from the women who almost all other products are marketed towards. 

**Q:** ***Is that it?***

Well, almost. I'm also doing this to be funny. 

Where are all the funny women on the internet? The only blogs I've found written by women provide "freebies" that let you print faux-letterpressed hearts on things, or ego-stroke everyone in existance for fostering the same design sensibilities. If it weren't for [badder homes and gardens](http://www.badderhomesandgardens.com/), I'd have no hope. 

**Q:** ***Are you saying women aren't funny?***

**A:** Aside from that being a leading question, I'll answer no. I'm just over this whole cutesy, vintage, pin-up girl phase. I thoroughly think we should go back to the mid 90's when [Janeane Garofalo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janeane_Garofalo) and [Ani DiFranco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ani_DiFranco) where considered popular. Come on, the baby boomers totally fucked our generation over. Why is everyone so passive about it?

**Q:** ***Woah. That got a little political, didn't it?***

**A:** Yeah. Sorry about that. I'll try to keep it to a minimum. (Although, let's admit that it's going to be filtered through to almost everything. Just sayin'.)

**Q:** ***Can I request a product review?***

**A:** Totally. In fact, email me and I'll start that list right now. User feedback. It's where it's at. 

*Maybe someday, this blog will be sponsored and we can do some kind of new fangled focus group where you give me the feedback.
